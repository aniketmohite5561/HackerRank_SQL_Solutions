1) Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
  The CITY table is described as follows:

Solution:-
  SELECT * FROM CITY
  WHERE POPULATION >100000 AND COUNTRYCODE = 'USA';

2) Write a query to find the corresponding Western Longitude value for the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes less than 137.2345 up to 4 decimal places.

Solution:-
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345);

3) Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to  decimal places.

Solution:-
  SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
  WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;
